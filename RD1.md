Objective:
In this project, the goal was to learn how to use functions to simplify and structure code in a cleaner way. Functions make code more modular, easier to manage, and enhance readability. Despite the challenges faced in implementing them, functions helped reduce repetition and made the overall design cleaner and more organized. The task was to create an ATM program that allowed users to deposit, withdraw, view their balance, and exit. Using functions made it possible to separate the logic of each of these tasks, which is a key skill I needed to accomplish.

Procedure:
The steps taken to solve the problem involved revisiting the code and algorithm from Lab 5, where we worked with simpler versions of ATM operations, and referring to lecture notes on functions. I followed the steps outlined in our notes to implement the correct use of functions, focusing on using elif statements to handle each ATM action (deposit, withdraw, view balance, and exit). Key techniques used to structure the program included creating a while loop that ran until the user decided to exit and writing clear and simple functions for each task. I had to make sure that variable names were consistent, and the code followed the logic we had discussed in the lab.

Key Concepts Explored:
The key concepts explored were functions, elif statements, and while loops. Functions allowed for dividing the code into logical sections for each action (deposit, withdraw, etc.), while elif statements helped in branching different choices the user could make. The while loop allowed the program to keep running until the user chose to exit, providing continuous interaction.

Results:
Yes, the results matched, and even exceeded my expectations. Despite the issues we initially faced when writing the code, breaking the problem down into functions worked better than I anticipated. We didn't test with extreme cases, but we did test the .lower() function to ensure that user inputs were handled correctly, regardless of whether the user typed uppercase or lowercase characters.

Reflection:
Challenges were mainly in implementing the functions and keeping variable names simple and clear to troubleshoot any errors. Using functions, while effective, took a lot of work to implement correctly. However, through teamwork, collaboration, and consistent reference to lecture notes and Lab 5 solutions, we were able to overcome these challenges. One key takeaway is that error handling and managing bad inputs are always emphasized in programming, and itâ€™s important to consider edge cases. I do believe I learned what I was supposed to, even though the process was stressful. Working with my partner was a great experience; he understood how to implement the functions well and contributed significantly to solving the problem.
