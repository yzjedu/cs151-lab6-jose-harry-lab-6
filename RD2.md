# Reflection Document

* Drive Full Name  : Harry Li
* Partner Full Name: Jose Carillo
* Student ID: 1930859
* In the lab working with my partner was a pain. he didnt tell me anything about the code or anything about the lab. Everything went well after he told me about the lab. I proceeded to create the fnction and code everything while he did the algorithm and test cases. There was many problems when i was creating the code. I had a limited knowledge about functions which led me to create a failed function making my whole code to be unable to function. Until i realised that i had to return a value into the parameter and update the variable outside of the function which doesnt relte to the main.py.
